Markdown is a way to style text on the web. It is a standard and popular choice used on many platforms such as Github, Reddit, Telegram, etc.

We chose Markdown because it's simple. No fancy buttons, to overwhelm you on your first usage of service! If you don't care about formatting and just want the basic plain text, you got it! If you're a developer, needing particular formats, you got that as well! 

You can use Markdown on Voten for writing text submissions, comments, messages, etc.
